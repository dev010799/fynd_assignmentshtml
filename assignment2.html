        Q2. This exercise helps understand the difference between inline, block,
        and inline-block display types. On an HTML page add 3 span elements each
        with the words HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Select the 3 elements using
        the span selector in an embedded style tag on the page and set the width
        to 40%.
      </p>

      <p class="BOLD">
        * How do the elements appear? Does the width have any effect? Why / Why
        not?
      </p>

      <p class="black">
        The elements appear in inline form. No, the width doesn't have any
        effect. This is because it is an inline element.
      </p>

      <p class="BOLD">
        * Next, set display to inline. Does it cause any change? Why / Why not?
      </p>

      <p class="black">
        It does not cause any changes because span is an inline container. This
        is because we are trying to change inline element to inline itelf.
      </p>

      <p class="BOLD">
        * Next, change display to block. What change does it cause?
      </p>

      <p class="black">
        This makes the span appear row wise. This is because it is now a block
        element. This happens because block takes the whole width of the screen.
        In block element we can also specify the width and height according to
        our need.
      </p>

      <p class="BOLD">
        * Next, set display to inline-block. What change does it cause?
      </p>

      <p class="black">
        It is an inline-block element which means that we can specify the width
        and height according to our need which is not possible in inline
        element.
      </p>

      <p class="BOLD">
        * In conclusion, summarize the differences you noticed in the 3 behavior
        of the 3 display types. Search for other differences and jot them down
        mentally / physically! :)
      </p>

      <p class="black">
        Inline element : In inline element all the elements are placed
        horizontally side by side. Cannot change the height and width of the
        element in this type.
        <strong>div and span are examples of Inline Element</strong><br />
        <br />

        Block element : In block element all elements are stacked vertically row
        wise. In this type we can change the height and width of the element
        <strong
          >p,ol,ul,dl,all headings,article,section,div are examples of Block
          Element</strong
        ><br /><br />

        Inline-block element : In inline-block all the elements are placed
        horizontally side by side but here we can specify the height and width
        of the element.
